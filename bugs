2) nodes of the type: Annotation with property private set to True are not matched against cypherstatements!

________________________

3) Texts should receive a UUIDv4Identifier.
  - As a general rule ANY AND ALL nodes need UUIDv4Identifiers!
  - Should receive a default attribute: private set to false!
  - Should receive an optional texid (recommended!)

4) Annotation.inc.php
  - you need to figure a way out to deal with non-existing properties of a node
  - Do not rely on static properties when creating an annotation: createAnnotation & createAnnotationWithExistingEt are both affected by this bug!


6) annotatoin.inc.php ==> method:  createAnnotation:
  - Uses static code, what if a property does not exist, rewrite!



11) Bug in getnode.inc.php
  - Code fetching the entity based on a string does realy on a hardcoded property name 'label'. 
    * Get the hardcoded dependency out of there
    * Make sure all names used to select an an entity become part of the variants connected to the Entity!

12) creation.js not working 
  - There's an issue with the submit event, 
    * the verification gets triggered propperly, but the actual storage of a new et doesn't work
    * as it is now, the only test has been done with Text type entities. 
    * preSubmitCheck() is missing a submit event!
