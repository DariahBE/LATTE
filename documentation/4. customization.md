# 4. Customization. 

Latte's behaviour regarding WikiData properties, links and languages can be customized to fit the project's needs. For this a site-admin can edit the file **\includes\\wikidata_user_prefs.inc.php**. The choices made here are applied on a system-wide level and include an option to set default values. 
Logged in users have the ability to select a specific subset that's selected by the site-administrator. 

There are three editable sections in this file: 

## 4.1 Linking to external wikis.
Entities have outgoing links to Wikipedia, these outgoing links are only rendered for the specific languages mentioned in the **$wikidataPrefixToWikipediaLinks** array.
Site-admins can add and remove languages as well as mark specific languages as 'default'. Please note that an outgoing link will only render in the DOM if there's an actual wikipedia page in that specific language. 

### 4.1.1 Removing a language option.
The variable **$wikidataPrefixToWikipediaLinks** determines which wikipedia language portals it'll link to. Simply remove one entry in this array and the language will not be offered as an option any longer. 

### 4.1.2 Adding a language option.
Adding a language can be done by adding a new entry to the variable **$wikidataPrefixToWikipediaLinks**. Each entry consists of a **key** (string) and **value** (array) component.
- The **key**-component is a string used as identifier by Wikidata to indicate a specific URL points to one specific wiki portal. In other words, these keys cannot be chosen at random. For a list of available keys consult the [wikidata documentation](https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?action=paraminfo&modules=wbsetlabel). The allowed keys are listed as part of the mediawiki result sample under **paraminfo.modules[0].parameters[2]**. Note that it is possible to add separate links to the english wikipedia page (using the enwiki-key) as well as the english wiki news outlet (using the enwikinews-key).
- Each key requies a **value**-component. This value is an array in the following format: 
    `key => array('baseuri', 'display_string', default_bool_flag), `. 

**baseuri:**
The baseuri can be found using the wikidata [search option](https://www.wikidata.org/), simply enter the key you wish to add and look for the value referenced at 'interwiki prefix at Wikimedia', this will show you a formatted url - you'll only need the string without it's placeholders as baseuri value. 
*Example for enwikivoyage: *
    - our key is 'enwikivoyage'
    - using the search function at [https://www.wikidata.org](https://www.wikidata.org), we find [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19826574](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19826574).
    - the interwiki prefix value shows: *https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/$1*, from this we can ignore the formatter, so the baseuri becomes: *https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/*. This should be the value added to the array.

**display_string:**
The display string is a short and clear description of the wiki you're linking to. There's no fixed convention to follow, but it should be clear to the project collaborators and end users. For the given usecase of enwikivoyage a good example would be: *Wikivoyage (en)*. There's no technical requirement for these strings to be unique; but it might help end users if they are.

**default_bool_flag:**
A True or False flag. If set to True, the link - when available - will be showed by default to the end user. 

### 4.1.3 Setting a language as default.
Using a language as default means that a non-logged in user, or a signed in user who didn't customize their preferences will see only the languages that are marked as default. Using a boolean flag, the language can be set to default or not. The flag is the last entry in the value array. When set to true, the language portal is considered to be a default portal. 

## 4.2 Wikidata Properties. 
Wikidata stores it's data in tripples, for entity X the property Y holds value Z. Where X is the entity indicated by a wikidata identifier starting with Q (e.g. Q123) and Y is a property tag starting with P (e.g. P123). The value part (Z) in the example will be shown to the user if the P-tag it belongs to is marked as default OR if the user has selected it as a property of interest.

### 4.2.1 Adding and removing properties.
For adding/removing properties, modifications are needed to the **$wikidataProperties** variable, a similar aproach may be used as for the language portals mentioned above. An entry in the properties list consists of a **key** (string) and **value** (array). The key is a property tag returned by WikiData, it follows a fixed format *P\<number\>* (e.g P123). 

There's no up to date list available of Wikidata Properties, but you can query the WIkidata API for relevant properties at [https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?action=wbsearchentities&search=capitol&language=en&type=property](https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?action=wbsearchentities&search=capitol&language=en&type=property). The provided URL will search for property-tags describing the *capitol*. You'll see it returns a property P792. 

If we want to know the property tag for the identifier used by an external project such as 'Pleiades', one queries the API like this: 
[https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?action=wbsearchentities&search=pleiades&language=en&type=property](https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?action=wbsearchentities&search=pleiades&language=en&type=property). Here it returns P1584 which should be used as a key. 

The **value** required for this key is an array with three values:
- *Label*: a string to use in the DOM together with the data retrieved from WikiData. This string can be chosen freely, but should be clearly understandable.
- *default_value* a boolean. When set to True, the data from wikidata will be shown by default. 
- *datatype*: four datatypes are available
    1) geo: a Point coordinate. Will visualize the data on a map.
    2) uri: Will make the data clickable and redirect users to external links.
    3) img: Will display an image
    4) str: Will render the returned wikidata value as a string in the DOM. 

Removing a value can be done easily by deleting the entry from **$wikidataProperties**. 

### 4.2.2 Setting a property as default. 
When a property is set as default, it'll show to all users that are not logged in and all logged in users who did not explicitly turn this option off. A property is set to default if the second value in the nested **$wikidataProperties** array is set to *True*.
